# glossbox

In writing papers in documentary linguistics, many linguists
us LaTeX to produce well-typeset material.  Many linguists also 
use the `expex` package to handle the typesetting of for Interlinear 
Glossed Examples (IGEs). 

Glossbox is a small Python program that expedites the process of 
generating LaTeX markup in the `expex` format directly from a 
Toolbox file. 

This has the advantage of making the Toolbox file the unique, 
canonical source of documentary data, and reduces the likelihood
of error when rendering examples. While a simple example, we see
this approach as one useful step toward reproducible research.
